\chapter{Related work}

This report is, in large part, a direct response to the research pioneered by
Adrian Tang et al. in his USENIX conference paper on \clkscrew{}~\cite{clkscrew}
published in August 2017. There does not appear to be any literature published
prior to this on the subject matter covered in this
report, though similar attack vectors have been explored in the past, such as
the Rowhammer exploit~\cite{rowhammer} first published in June 2014. Here, we
cover the existing work by Tang in \cite{clkscrew} and his related paper
concerning the Blacklist Core technology~\cite{blacklistCore} developed to
defend against \clkscrew{}-style attacks. We also touch on the existence of
Intel's trusted execution environment, dubbed Software Guard Extensions (SGX),
and how the \clkscrew{} attack may be a suitable attack vector for SGX, as also
mentioned in~\cite{securityOfSGX}. In fact, the work detailed in this report
could lay the foundation for developing a \clkscrew{}-style attack against
Intel SGX, as discussed in ยง\ref{sec:future}.
