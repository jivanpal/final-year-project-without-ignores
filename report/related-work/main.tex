\chapter{Related work}

In this section, we cover existing literature relevant to the subject matter of
this report. This report is, in large part, a direct response to the research
pioneered by Adrian Tang et al. in his paper on
\clkscrew{}~\cite{clkscrew} published in August 2017. There does not appear to
be any directly relevant literature published prior to this, though similar
attack vectors have been explored in the past, such as
the Rowhammer exploit~\cite{rowhammer} first published in June 2014. Here, we
cover the existing work in~\cite{clkscrew} and a related paper
concerning the Blacklist Core technology~\cite{blacklistCore} designed to
defend against \clkscrew{}-style attacks. We also touch on the existence of
Intel's trusted execution environment, dubbed Software Guard Extensions (SGX),
and how the power management attacks may be a suitable attack vector for SGX, as also
mentioned in~\cite{securityOfSGX}. In fact, the work detailed in this report
could lay the foundation for developing a power management attack against
Intel SGX, as discussed in ยง\ref{sec:future}.
