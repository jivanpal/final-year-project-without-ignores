Family of attacks with DVFS as the attack vector, demonstrated on an ARM device
(Nexus 6 smartphone).
Attacker injects fault during an AES decryption routine (running in ARM
TrustZone) via a malicious kernel driver to cause incorrect plaintext to be
generated from ciphertext.
Differential fault analysis (Tunstall, 2011) yields the AES key in minutes.
