\section{The Security of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)}

The possibility of Intel SGX being vulnerable to power management attacks is
discussed in~\cite{securityOfSGX}. In particular, the author writes:

\begin{quotation}
    "We remark that the \clkscrew{} attack was not demonstrated specifically
    against SGX. However, as the researchers argue, the attack is relevant for
    all hardware that enables energy management (which is essentially all modern
    platforms). We note that AWS does provide processor state control for EC2
    instances as required for the CLKSCREW attack, but stress that the attack
    has not been demonstrated on this specific platform. Thus, the question of
    the attack’s relevance to SGX in real cloud environments is still open."
\end{quotation}

Whether SGX is indeed vulnerable to the attacks on ARM TrustZone detailed
in~\cite{clkscrew} is still up for debate, hence our desire to demonstrate them
ourselves. We do not actually explore this avenue in this report, but this is
discussed further in §\ref{sec:future}.
