\section{Determining unstable OPPs (operating performance points)}

For each frequency, step down the voltage incrementally until the system
crashes. Record the last stable voltage. Plot these data to identify the
stable/unstable OPPs, and more importantly, the boundary between these regions
so that we know what values to test in order to inject a fault.
