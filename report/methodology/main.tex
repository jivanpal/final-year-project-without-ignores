\chapter{Methodology}

In this section, we discuss the interfaces available to us that allow us to set
DVFS parameters. We determine those OPPs which render the system unstable, and
then use the acquired information in ยง\ref{sec:tools} to develop the previously
mentioned kernel module in order to try and induce and witness a computational
fault. Throughout this paper, the testbench we use is an Intel Core i5-4590
desktop computer running Arch Linux with Linux kernel version 5.0.4.
