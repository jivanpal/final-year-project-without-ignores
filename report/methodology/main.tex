\chapter{Methodology}

In this section, we discuss the interfaces available to us that allow us to set
DVFS parameters. We determine those OPPs which render the system unstable, and
then use the acquired information in ยง\ref{sec:observing-fault} to develop a
kernel module which alters the DVFS parameters at appropriate times in order to
induce a computational fault which we can observe. Throughout this report, the
testbench we use is an Intel Core i5-4590 desktop computer running Arch Linux
with Linux kernel version 5.0.4.
