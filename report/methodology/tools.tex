Generate and save some random data
Compute its SHA-1 hash correctly in a stable state
Attempt to compute the SHA-1 hash again at different OPPs until we see an
incorrect hash is computed. The machine crashes before we get the chance to see
the computation, so we need to inject the fault at a lower level in order to
change the voltage in shorter bursts.

We create a custom `sha1sum` binary which changes the core voltage during its
execution.
Need to execute in kernel mode so that MSRs can be read/written in order to
change the voltage.
We create a custom kernel module for this purpose which computes SHA-1 hash
when inserted into the kernel via `insmod`.
