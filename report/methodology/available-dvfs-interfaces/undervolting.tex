\subsection{Voltage scaling}
\label{sec:undervolt}

Intel does not seem to provide any documentation for the voltage
scaling interface in their Intel Core processors, though a closed-source
Windows utility called ThrottleStop \cite{throttlestop} exists to control DVFS
parameters. This utility has been reverse-engineered \cite{elersicDoc},
revealing that a model-specific register (MSR) exists in this line of processors
to read and write setting related to voltage scaling. Specifically, the MSR with
address 0x150 acts as an interface for voltage scaling, although this is also
not officially documented by Intel in \cite[Vol. 4, ยง2.13]{intelDevManual} as
would be expected.

Using this interface, it is possible to adjust the voltage offset from the base
voltage in units of $\frac{1}{1024}$~volts. The MSR uses an 11-bit signed 
nteger to describe the offset from the base voltage in these units, thus
allowing a maximum voltage offset of $\pm{1}$~volts. A front-end utility called
\code{undervolt} \cite{whewellUndervolt} has been developed in Python to more
easily use the interface described in \cite{elersicDoc}. We use \code{undervolt}
in ยง\ref{sec:unstableOPPs}.
