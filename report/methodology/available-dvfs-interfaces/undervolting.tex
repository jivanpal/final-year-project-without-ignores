\subsection{Undervolting}

Can we undervolt?

Intel i5-4590, appears to have base voltage of 8.8 volts.

Model-specific registers (MSRs) exist for controlling voltage offset, but no
documentation is provided by Intel regarding this!
No matter — someone (Miha Eleršič) reverse-engineered Throttlestop, and someone
else (George Whewell) provided a nice frontend to change the voltage offsets.
Undervolting is possible in increments of ~1 millivolt.
