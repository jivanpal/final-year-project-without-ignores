\subsection{Voltage scaling}

Unfortunately, Intel does not seem to provide any documentation for the voltage
scaling interface in their Intel Core processors, though a closed-source
Windows utility called ThrottleStop \cite{throttlestop} exists to control DVFS
parameters. This utility has been reverse-engineered \cite{elersicDoc},
revealing that a model-specific register (MSR) exists to read and write settings
related to voltage scaling. Specifically, the MSR with address 0x150 acts as an
interface for voltage scaling, though this is also not officially documented by
Intel in \cite[Volume 4, ยง2.13]{intelDevManual}, as would be expected.

Using this interface, it is possible to adjust the voltage offset from the base
voltage in units of $\frac{1}{1024}$ volts. The voltage offset number used by
the MSR is an 11-bit signed integer, thus allowing a maximum voltage offset of
$\pm{1}$ volts. A front-end utility called \code{undervolt} \cite{whewellUndervolt}
has been developed in Python to more easily use the interface described in
\cite{elersicDoc}. We use \code{undervolt} in ยง\ref{sec:unstableOPPs}.
