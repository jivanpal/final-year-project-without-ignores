\subsection{Frequency scaling}

\subsubsection{CPU performance scaling in the Linux kernel}

The Linux kernel natively supports frequency scaling as part of its \code{CPUFreq}
subsystem, documented in \cite{linuxCPUScaling}. Precisely one scaling driver is
registered with the subsystem during boot time, which implements at least one
scaling governor: an algorithm that determines which OPP each CPU core should be
set to use at any given moment. Precisely one governor is in use at any given time.

Standard governors include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \code{performance} — enforces use of the most powerful OPP, at the
        expense of having poor energy efficiency;
    \item \code{powersave} — enforces use of the least powerful OPP, at the
        expense of having limited computational power;
    \item \code{schedutil} — uses data available from the CPU scheduler to make
        an educated guess as to which OPP is most suitable for the current
        workload; and
    \item \code{userspace} — allows userspace utilties to request use of a
        particular OPP via SysFS.
\end{itemize}

The standard governors listed above are implemented by the \code{acpi-cpufreq}
driver, which can be used by the majority of modern CPUs, including those in
the Intel Core series. However, processers in the Intel Core series from the
2nd generation (Sandy Bridge) and later notably have a much larger, more
granular set of P-states than is typical \cite{intelDevManual}, with the CPU
itself managing which specific P-state to use; rather than this decision being
made by the kernel/operating system and then the CPU being instructed to use 
the chosen P-state. This self-selection feature is known as HWP
(hardware-managed P-states). In order to take advantage of HWP, the
\code{intel\_pstate} driver \cite{linuxIntelPState} was devised, which only
implements the following scaling governors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \code{performance} — behaves as detailed above; and
    \item \code{powersave} — despite having the same name as the
        \code{powersave} governor of \code{acpi-cpufreq}, this governor instead
        behaves like the \code{schedutil} governor of \code{acpi-cpufreq},
        choosing a P-state most suitable for the current workload based on
        information provided by the CPU's own feedback registers.
\end{itemize}

Observe that there is no analogue to the \code{userspace} governor; neither of
the two governors offered by \code{intel\_pstate} allow userspace processes to
directly choose which P-state should be used. In order to overcome this barrier,
we can choose not to use the \code{intel\_pstate} driver by specifying
\code{intel\_pstate=disable} on the kernel command line (i.e. before boot),
at which point the kernel will default to using \code{acpi-cpufreq} instead.

\subsubsection{Setting the CPU frequency}
\label{sec:cpupower}

The \code{CPUFreq} subsystem exposes an interface in SysFS that allows us to
set the current P-state as desired. A front-end utility called \code{cpupower}
exists to more easily use this SysFS interface, and is available in the Arch
Linux repositories as detailed in \cite{archFrequency}. We use \code{cpupower}
in §\ref{sec:unstableOPPs}.

When using the \code{acpi-cpufreq} driver, we find that the range of possible
frequencies is quite limited. Reading \code{/dev/cpuinfo} shows that the
following options are available:

\begin{multicols}{3}\raggedcolumns
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 800 MHz
        \item 1000 MHz
        \item 1200 MHz
        \item 1300 MHz
        \item 1500 MHz
        \item 1700 MHz
        \item 1900 MHz
        \item 2000 MHz
        \item 2200 MHz
        \item 2400 MHz
        \item 2600 MHz
        \item 2800 MHz
        \item 2900 MHz
        \item 3100 MHz
        \item 3300 MHz
        \item 3301 MHz
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

The last of these options, 3301 MHz, is actually the driver's way of exposing
the ability to use Intel Turbo Boost.[CITE — CPUFreq using max frequency + 1 Mhz]
Our CPU's base frequency is 3300 MHz,
with Turbo support for 3700 MHz. Requesting that the CPU frequency be set to
3301 MHz simply causes the CPU the enter Turbo Boost mode, at which point the
frequency will range between 3400 MHz and 3700 MHz depending on the
workload.[CITE — HOW DOES TURBO BOOST OPERATE]
