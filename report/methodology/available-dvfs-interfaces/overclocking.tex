\subsection{Overclocking}

Can we overclock?

Intel i5-4590 (Haswell), 3.4GHz base clock, 3.7GHz “turbo” mode.

Intel P-states (performance states) managed internally by the CPU itself (“HWP”
implemented in Linux `intel\_pstate` driver), not by the OS, so we cannot specify
which P-state to use. :-(

We revert to the `acpi\_cpufreq` driver to allow us to explicitly set the CPU
frequency via the `cpupower` command. :-)

Only certain frequencies available, not as granular as we would like; increments
of 100 MHz or 200 MHz.
