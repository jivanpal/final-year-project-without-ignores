\section{Future work}

[TBD]

Once proof of concept is complete, work on writing malicious kernel driver
which targets a legitimate sha1sum binary running in user mode to achieve the
same effect.
Now have access to a 7th generation (Kaby Lake) machine for further
investigation â€” Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX; analogous to ARM
TrustZone) introduced in 6th generation (Skylake).
Would be nice to explore breaking SGX, even better if positive results
