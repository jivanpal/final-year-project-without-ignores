\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future}

As discussed in ยง\ref{sec:clkscrew-review}, prior research in this area has
demonstrated complete attacks using power management as an attack vector. We
would like to have explored this ourselves and develop the necessary kernel
module as discussed in ยง\ref{sec:observing-fault} which would prey on programs
running in userspace to achieve the same effect as we have already observed.

Once such a kernel module is developed, we would also like to explore SGX
specifically, as discussed in ยง\ref{sec:summary}, attempting to observe the
same results once again, but with a program that makes exclusive use of memory
in an SGX enclave as the victim. This would require access to a 6th generation
Skylake or later Intel Core processor, as SGX is not present on earlier units.
If such an observation is made, the natural next step is to replicate the AES
key extraction attack in~\cite{clkscrew} on this platform, with the AES
decryption program running exclusively in an SGX enclave.

More recent processors using the x86 instruct set implement specific
instructions for efficiently computing the results of AES rounds. These
additional instructions are known as the AES New Instructions (AES-NI)~\cite{aesni}.
If the AES key extraction attack is possible on devices using Intel Core
processors that support SGX, it is in our interest to explore whether the AES
key extraction attack in~\cite{clkscrew} is still possible if AES-NI
instructions are being employed.
