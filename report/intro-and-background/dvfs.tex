\section{DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling)}

DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) allows the adjustment of the
following aspects of processor cores via software:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the voltage supplied to them
    \item their clock speed (frequency)
\end{itemize}
These parameters can each be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item decreased in order to decrease energy consumption
    \item increased in order to increase computational power/speed
\end{itemize}
These parameters are dynamically adjusted via software depending on demand to
balance the trade-off between energy efficiency and computing power.
