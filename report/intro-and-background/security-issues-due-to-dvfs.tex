\section{Security issues due to DVFS}

CPUs contain flip-flops, which are used to store and propagate state information
inside the CPU.
If the next flip-flop in a series receives the clock pulse before its input
changes, it will incorrectly propagate a flipped bit.
Perhaps an attacker can force such behaviour to occur?

Undervolting and overclocking do the trick!
Overclocking shortens clock cycles.
Undervolting causes it to take more time for a signal to propagate from one
flip-flop to the next.
Fault occurs if $T_{\mathrm{clk}}$ is sufficiently small compared to
$T_{\mathrm{max\_path}}$.
