\section{Contribution and outline}

We expand upon the work done in producing the \clkscrew{}
exploit~\cite{clkscrew}, applying the principles detailed there to attempt to
demonstrate the same vulnerabilities on the Intel Core series of processors.
Firstly, we explore the extent to which software-accessible interfaces for DVFS
exist on the platform. Secondly, we use these interfaces to determine which OPPs
cause system inability. Finally, we devise a kernel module which temporarily
puts the system into an unstable state whilst computing a SHA-1 hash in the
hopes that an incorrect hash is computed; this would serve to prove that the
\clkscrew{} vulnerability is at least achievable, and perhaps exploitable on
this platform.
