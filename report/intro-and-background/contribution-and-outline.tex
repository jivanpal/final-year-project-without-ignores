\section{Contribution and outline}

We expand upon the work in \cite{clkscrew}, applying the principles detailed
there to attempt to demonstrate the same vulnerabilities on Intel's Core
series of processors. Firstly, we explore the extent to which
software-accessible interfaces for DVFS exist on the platform. Secondly, we use
these interfaces to determine which OPPs (operating performance points) cause
system inability. Finally, we devise a kernel module which temporarily puts the
system into an unstable state whilst computing a SHA-1 hash in the hopes that
an incorrect hash is computed; this would serve to prove that the \clkscrew{}
vulnerability is achievable, and perhaps exploitable on this platform.
