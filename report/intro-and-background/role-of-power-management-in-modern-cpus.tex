\section{Role of power management in modern CPUs}

Power management is a necessary, unavoidable feature of all modern-day
computers.
Todayâ€™s end-users expect devices to be energy efficient in order to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item prolong battery life
    \item reduce device temperatures
\end{itemize}
This is achieved through various means, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item efficient application multi-tasking principles
    \item traditional power saving measures (e.g. standby times)
    \item dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)
\end{itemize}
